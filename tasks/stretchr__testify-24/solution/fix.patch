+`suite` package
+---------------
+
+The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.
+
+An example suite is shown below:
+
+    // Basic imports
+    import (
+        "testing"
+        "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
+        "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
+    )
+
+    // Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
+    // functionality from testify - including a T() method which
+    // returns the current testing context
+    type ExampleTestSuite struct {
+        suite.Suite
+        VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
+    }
+
+    // Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
+    // before each test
+    func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
+        suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
+    }
+
+    // All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
+    // suite.
+    func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
+        assert.Equal(suite.T(), suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
+    }
+
+    // In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
+    // a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
+    func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
+        suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
+    }
+
+For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

+// The suite package contains logic for creating testing suite structs
+// and running the methods on those structs as tests.  The most useful
+// piece of this package is that you can create setup/teardown methods
+// on your testing suites, which will run before/after the whole suite
+// or individual tests (depending on which interface(s) you
+// implement).
+//
+// A testing suite is usually built by first extending the built-in
+// suite functionality from suite.Suite in testify.  Alternatively,
+// you could reproduce that logic on your own if you wanted (you
+// just need to implement the TestingSuite interface from
+// suite/interfaces.go).
+//
+// After that, you can implement any of the interfaces in
+// suite/interfaces.go to add setup/teardown functionality to your
+// suite, and add any methods that start with "Test" to add tests.
+// Methods that do not match any suite interfaces and do not begin
+// with "Test" will not be run by testify, and can safely be used as
+// helper methods.
+//
+// Once you've built your testing suite, you need to run the suite
+// (using suite.Run from testify) inside any function that matches the
+// identity that "go test" is already looking for (i.e.
+// func(*testing.T)).
+//
+// A crude example:
+//     // Basic imports
+//     import (
+//         "testing"
+//         "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
+//         "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
+//     )
+//
+//     // Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
+//     // functionality from testify - including a T() method which
+//     // returns the current testing context
+//     type ExampleTestSuite struct {
+//         suite.Suite
+//         VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
+//     }
+//
+//     // Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
+//     // before each test
+//     func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
+//         suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
+//     }

+//     // All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
