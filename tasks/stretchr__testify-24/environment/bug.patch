-`suite` package
----------------
-
-The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.
-
-An example suite is shown below:
-
-    // Basic imports
-    import (
-        "testing"
-        "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
-        "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
-    )
-
-    // Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
-    // functionality from testify - including a T() method which
-    // returns the current testing context
-    type ExampleTestSuite struct {
-        suite.Suite
-        VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
-    }
-
-    // Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
-    // before each test
-    func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
-        suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
-    }
-
-    // All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
-    // suite.
-    func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
-        assert.Equal(suite.T(), suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
-    }
-
-    // In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
-    // a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
-    func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
-        suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
-    }
-
-For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

-// The suite package contains logic for creating testing suite structs
-// and running the methods on those structs as tests.  The most useful
-// piece of this package is that you can create setup/teardown methods
-// on your testing suites, which will run before/after the whole suite
-// or individual tests (depending on which interface(s) you
-// implement).
-//
-// A testing suite is usually built by first extending the built-in
-// suite functionality from suite.Suite in testify.  Alternatively,
-// you could reproduce that logic on your own if you wanted (you
-// just need to implement the TestingSuite interface from
-// suite/interfaces.go).
-//
-// After that, you can implement any of the interfaces in
-// suite/interfaces.go to add setup/teardown functionality to your
-// suite, and add any methods that start with "Test" to add tests.
-// Methods that do not match any suite interfaces and do not begin
-// with "Test" will not be run by testify, and can safely be used as
-// helper methods.
-//
-// Once you've built your testing suite, you need to run the suite
-// (using suite.Run from testify) inside any function that matches the
-// identity that "go test" is already looking for (i.e.
-// func(*testing.T)).
-//
-// A crude example:
-//     // Basic imports
-//     import (
-//         "testing"
-//         "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
-//         "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
-//     )
-//
-//     // Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
-//     // functionality from testify - including a T() method which
-//     // returns the current testing context
-//     type ExampleTestSuite struct {
-//         suite.Suite
-//         VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
-//     }
-//
-//     // Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
-//     // before each test
-//     func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
-//         suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
-//     }
-//
-//     // All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
-//     // suite.
-//     func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
-//         assert.Equal(suite.T(), suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
-//     }
-//
-//     // In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
