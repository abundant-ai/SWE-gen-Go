Circuit breaker settings from xDS Cluster configuration are not being applied when the Cluster type is LOGICAL_DNS. Today, these settings are effectively only plumbed/applied for EDS clusters, which means requests routed to LOGICAL_DNS clusters ignore circuit breaker limits that should constrain concurrent requests.

When an xDS configuration defines circuit breakers (e.g., max pending requests / max requests / max retries) on a Cluster, those limits must be enforced regardless of whether the Cluster resolves endpoints via EDS or via LOGICAL_DNS. With the current behavior, the same circuit breaker configuration works for EDS clusters but does not take effect for LOGICAL_DNS clusters, allowing traffic to exceed the configured limits.

Update the xDS cluster implementation so that circuit breaker configuration is propagated and enforced for LOGICAL_DNS clusters the same way it is for EDS clusters. After the fix, creating/updating a LOGICAL_DNS cluster with circuit breaker thresholds should result in the cluster implementation applying those thresholds during picking/handling RPCs such that exceeding the configured limits causes new RPCs to fail immediately with an appropriate gRPC error (e.g., unavailable/resource-exhausted style behavior consistent with existing circuit breaker handling), matching the behavior already observed for EDS clusters.
