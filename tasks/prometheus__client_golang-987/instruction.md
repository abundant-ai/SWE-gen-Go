HTTP handler instrumentation in the `promhttp` package is vulnerable to unbounded metric label cardinality when requests use non-standard/attacker-controlled HTTP methods (CVE-2022-21698). When an application instruments handlers using `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware (e.g., `InstrumentHandlerCounter`, `InstrumentHandlerDuration`, etc.) with a metric that includes a `method` label, the middleware currently uses `r.Method` directly as the label value. If a client sends many requests with distinct, non-standard method strings, the resulting metrics series cardinality grows without bound, potentially leading to memory exhaustion/DoS.

Update the `promhttp` instrumentation so that label values for `method` and HTTP `code` are validated/sanitized before being used to create/lookup metric series. By default, only a known-safe allow list of standard HTTP methods should be accepted for the `method` label value; any other method should not create a new series (it should be mapped to a stable fallback value such as "unknown"/"other" rather than the raw method string). Similarly, the `code` label value should be restricted to valid HTTP status code representations used by the middleware (e.g., "200", "500", and a stable value for cases where a code is not known/recorded).

The middleware must still allow users to opt into additional custom methods explicitly. Provide an option named `WithExtraMethods(...string)` that extends the default method allow list so that specified custom methods are treated as valid label values (and thus do not get collapsed into the fallback label value). This option must work consistently when passed to different `InstrumentHandler*` helpers, and it must be possible to use the same option instance across multiple instrumentations.

Also ensure label-name checking remains correct: metrics passed into the instrumentation that have variable labels must only use supported variable label names (not arbitrary ones), while const/curried labels must still follow Prometheus label naming rules. If unsupported variable label names are provided to the instrumentation helpers, the middleware should refuse configuration (panic or otherwise clearly fail fast, consistent with existing behavior).

After the change, sending requests with random/unique HTTP methods through an instrumented handler must not cause unbounded growth in time series; only the default allow-listed methods (plus those added via `WithExtraMethods`) may appear as distinct `method` label values, and all other methods must be folded into the stable fallback value.
