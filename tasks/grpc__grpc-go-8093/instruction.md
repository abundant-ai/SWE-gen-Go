When using the xDS client watch APIs, errors returned to watchers (and ultimately surfaced to users as part of RPC failures) do not currently include the xDS node ID, making it hard to diagnose which xDS node identity triggered the failure. The xDS node ID configured via bootstrap should be included in errors emitted from the WatchResource API whenever possible.

Specifically, when a resource watch is registered via the WatchResource-based helpers (for example, resource-specific watch helpers like WatchRouteConfig/WatchListener that rely on WatchResource internally), and the watch encounters an error (e.g., discovery response validation errors, stream/RPC errors from the management server, or other watch-level failures), the error delivered to the watcher must contain the node ID used by the xDS client. The node ID should appear in the error string so that callers can assert it is present (for example via substring matching). If the xDS client has an empty/unspecified node ID, behavior should remain reasonable (do not crash); include the node ID only when available.

Reproduction scenario: create an xDS client from a bootstrap configuration that specifies a node ID, register one or more resource watches, and trigger a watch error (for example by having the management server return an invalid response or otherwise forcing a watch failure). The watcher’s OnError callback currently receives an error that lacks the node ID. Expected behavior: the error received by the watcher includes the configured node ID (e.g., contains "nodeID" or equivalent formatting including the actual node identifier) while preserving the original error semantics (the underlying failure reason should still be present).
